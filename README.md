## Obsidian Todoist

This is a plugin that aims to connect Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) with the excellent task manager OmniFocus.

It works by calling AppleScript from within the plugin, this will only work on a Mac with OmniFocus 3 already installed. OmniFocus does not have a REST API that I know of, making this the only approach I could come up with.

Contributions are more than welcome, I know virtually no JavaScript and this is my first foray into the language.
